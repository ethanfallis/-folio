<p>
10+ years experience in cello, orchestral, and chamber music, and more than 5 years experience in private teaching and education.
</p>

<p>
During the years of my performance and pedagogical studies, I have come to realize the necessity of an educator’s ability to perform. I strongly believe that in order to be a great educator, one must also be a great performer. 
</p>

<p>
As a teacher and professional musician, it strive to be the greatest cellist I can so that I can be the strongest teacher as well. With extensive individual instruction in addition to my chamber and orchestral experience, I will be able to incorporate every aspect of my musical growth into my life, and more importantly, my students.
