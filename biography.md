## the beginnings

Ethan had been playing cello for two years before taking his first lessons with Karin Hendricks. By the age of fifteen, he began studying under Anne Francis of the Fry Street Quartet. Throughout his high school and college years, Ethan attended a variety of music camps and festivals, including Rocky Ridge Music Center in Colorado, Madeline Island Music Festival in Wisconsin, and Brevard Music Festival in North Carolina. One of the most memorable festivals Ethan has attended was the Classical Music Festival in Eisenstadt, Austria. While there, Ethan rehearsed and performed in my musically historical places including Esterhazy’s Palace, Haydn’s Church, and St. Stephens Cathedral under the baton of Dr. Richard Zalinsky and Don Moses.


## the school years

During his time at Utah State University, Ethan met great musicians and professors with whom he worked closely. Every year, Ethan had the opportunity to play and perform chamber music with coaching from the members of Fry Street Quartet. Orchestral studies at Utah State included collaborative projects such as Mozart's *The Magic Flute* and Mendelssohn's *A Midsummer Nights Dream* with the opera and theater program. The orchestra also had the opportunity to perform Mahler's 5th Symphony as well as Stravinsky’s *The Rite of Spring* with the University of Utah. While attending Utah State, Ethan had many opportunities to play and teach in the area. Shortly after his freshman year, he began expanding his own personal studio and auditioning for local ensembles. By the end of Ethan’s time at Utah State, he was playing regularly with the Cache Civic Ballet, the American Festival Chorus, and the Utah Festival Opera Company. Some of Ethan’s most memorable performances with these ensembles include annual performances of the Nutcracker, and even a show with ABBA.

Studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder built greater chamber and orchestral projects for Ethan. He knew by this point in his educational career that he wanted to become a great teacher but lacked the performance and pedagogical skills necessary to become that great teacher. While studying at CU-Boulder, Ethan was able to work closely with the Taqacs Quartet and the orchestral conductor, Gary Lewis. Some orchestral projects included Tchaikovsky’s 4th symphony, Rachmaninov’s 2nd symphony, Bloch’s Concerto Grosso, and a concert with Natalie Merchant. Ethan also had opportunities to find himself smaller ensembles to perform the greater works of the chamber world. He was able to perform in many string and piano ensembles that included Faure’s Quartet in C minor, Beethoven’s *Ghost* Piano Trio, Schumann’s Piano Quintet op. 44, and Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in D minor.
	
Ethan currently resides in the greater Boston area where he teaches and freelances full time. When not practicing, performing, or teaching, Ethan enjoys to ski, play the occasional video game, watch and analyze movies, cook, and travel Europe. Someday, he hopes to live in many different countries to learn of their languages and cultures. Over the years, 

Ethan earned a Bachelor Degree of Music Education from Utah State University in 2013, and a Masters Degree in Cello Performance and String Pedagogy at the University of Colorado in Boulder in 2015. Ethan has studied with with Karin Hendricks, Anne Francis, Walter Haman, Matthew Zalkind, Judith Glyde, and Thomas Heinrich.
